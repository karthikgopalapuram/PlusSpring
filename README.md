# PlusSpring
Spring Annotation based project

Hi All,
  This is a basic example for login page designed using the spring mvc, security annotation based. But the example is 
  taken from github public repository of "sivaprasadreddy/sivalabs-blog-samples-code". 
  Thank you sir for providing the example with us. I'm new to programming so this is a learning material, may be when 
  I'm creating the classes the author name might have changed to my name as that was the eclipse settings, even though 
  the mentioned name as author in the files is my name but it is not my own code, this code belongs to the above said repository.
  
  Thank you for understanding.
